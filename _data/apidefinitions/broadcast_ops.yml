    An operation on Steem is a way of expressing intention on the blockchain.
    They are also known as Broadcast Operations.  They have types, like `vote`
    or `comment`.  They pass parameters like `author` and `permlink`, depending
    on what their purpose is.
    
    Operations are grouped into transactions and passed as parameters to
    methods like `network_broadcast_api.broadcast_transaction_synchronous`, in
    the `operations` array.  Transactions must be signed in order for the
    blockchain to accept them.  Here is an example of a transaction that
    contains one operation (shown without signatures).
    
    ```json
    {
       "jsonrpc":"2.0",
       "method":"network_broadcast_api.broadcast_transaction_synchronous",

  ops:
    - name: vote
      virtual: false
      purpose: |
        This operation is used to cast a vote on a post/comment.  The primary
        purpose of voting is to express Proof-of-Brain about content to the
        blockchain.  When a vote is cast, the content is considered in the
        consensus rules involving author and curation rewards.
        
        An upvote can be cast from the point in time that the content is created
        up to 6.5 days.  The remaining 12 hours are locked out of upvotes at
        which time only downvotes may be cast.
        
        A secondary aspect to voting involves reputation, which is not part of
        consensus.
        
        *Reputation Rules:*
        1. Must have non-negative reputation to effect another user's reputation.
        2. If you are down voting another user, you must have more reputation than them to impact their reputation.

        **Notes:**
        * `voter`: must be a valid account name
        * `author`: must be a valid account name
        * `permlink`: must be content created by `author`
        * `weight`: absolute value must not be more than 10000 (100.00 %).

        another account vesting shares so that faucets can pre-fund new accounts
        with vesting shares.

        cash out at any time between 0 and their total vesting stake.
        
        After applying this operation, vesting_shares will be withdrawn
        at a rate of vesting_shares/13 per week for 13 weeks starting
        one week after this operation is included in the blockchain.
        
        This operation is not valid if the user has no vesting shares.

        This operation is used to report a miner who signs two blocks
        at the same time. To be valid, the violation must be reported within
        STEEM_MAX_WITNESSES blocks of the head block (1 round) and the
        producer must be in the ACTIVE witness set.
        
        Users not in the ACTIVE witness set should not have to worry about their
        key getting compromised and being used to produced multiple blocks so
        the attacker can report it and steel their vesting steem.
        
        The result of the operation is to transfer the full VESTING STEEM balance
        of the block producer to the reporter.

        Users who wish to become a witness must pay a fee acceptable to
        the current witnesses to apply for the position and allow voting
        to begin.
        
        If the owner isn't a witness they will become a witness.  Witnesses
        are charged a fee equal to 1 weeks worth of witness pay which in
        turn is derived from the current share supply.  The fee is
        only applied if the owner is not already a witness.
        
        If the block_signing_key is null then the witness is removed from
        contention.  The network will pick the top 21 witnesses for
        producing blocks.
        
        **Notes:**
        * The fee paid to register a new witness, should be 10x current
        block production pay.

        Serves the same purpose as `custom` but also supports required posting

        ##### `follow`
        
        As of HF9, the follow plugin will track follow/unfollow/ignore events.
        
        ##### `reblog`
        
        As of HF14, allows users to share blogs they find with those who follow
        them. This change implemented entirely outside the blockchain consensus
        which means that reblogging does not create a new post, it merely shares
        an existing post with people who follow you.
        
        ##### `witness`
        
        As of HF18, the witness plugin has a custom operation called
        `enable_content_editing` that allows a user to signal they want to edit
        their content. By consensus, content is editable indefinitely, but is
        soft forked to be frozen after payout. This operation requires an
        `active` key and is designed to prevent vandalism if a posting key is
        compromised. [#1017](https://github.com/steemit/steem/issues/1017)

      purpose: |
        Authors of posts may not want all of the benefits that come from creating a post. This
        operation allows authors to update properties associated with their post.
        
        Typically, these options will accompany a `comment` operation in the same transaction.
        
        As of HF17, content can specify beneficiaries to receive a part of
        their author rewards. The beneficiaries are specified in the extension
        field of the `comment_options_operation` and is a sorted vector (by
        account name) of account name, weight pairs. The beneficiaries can only
        be specified once and must be specified before any votes are cast on the
        comment. Most apps are already adding a `comment_options` in the

      purpose: |
        All account recovery requests come from a listed recovery account. This
        is secure based on the assumption that only a trusted account should be
        a recovery account. It is the responsibility of the recovery account to
        verify the identity of the account holder of the account to recover by
        whichever means they have agreed upon. The blockchain assumes identity
        has been verified when this operation is broadcast.
        
        This operation creates an account recovery request which the account to
        recover has 24 hours to respond to before the request expires and is
        invalidated.
        
        There can only be one active recovery request per account at any one time.
        Pushing this operation for an account to recover when it already has
        an active request will either update the request to a new new owner authority
        and extend the request expiration to 24 hours from the current head block
        time or it will delete the request. To cancel a request, simply set the
        weight threshold of the new owner authority to 0, making it an open authority.
        
        Additionally, the new owner authority must be satisfiable. In other words,
        the sum of the key weights must be greater than or equal to the weight
        threshold.
        
        This operation only needs to be signed by the the recovery account.
        The account to recover confirms its identity to the blockchain in
        the recover account operation.
        
        **Notes:**
        
        * `recovery_account`: The recovery account is listed as the recovery account
          on the account to recover.
        * `account_to_recover`: The account to recover. This is likely due to a
          compromised owner authority.
        * `new_owner_authority`: The new owner authority the account to recover
          wishes to have. This is secret known by the account to recover and
          will be confirmed in a `recover_account`.

        Each account lists another account as their recovery account.
        The recovery account has the ability to create `account_recovery_requests`
        for the account to recover. An account can change their recovery account
        at any time with a 30 day delay. This delay is to prevent
        an attacker from changing the recovery account to a malicious account
        during an attack. These 30 days match the 30 days that an
        owner authority is valid for recovery purposes.
        
        On account creation the recovery account is set either to the creator of
        the account (The account that pays the creation fee and is a signer on the transaction)
        or to the empty string if the account was mined. An account with no recovery
        has the top voted witness as a recovery account, at the time the recover
        request is created. Note: This does mean the effective recovery account
        of an account with no listed recovery account can change at any time as
        witness vote weights. The top voted witness is explicitly the most trusted
        witness according to stake.

        The purpose of this operation is to enable someone to send money

        releases it to *to* or *to* refunds it to *from*.
        
        In the event of a dispute the *agent* can divide the funds between the

        dispute deadline time, after the escrow has been approved by all
        parties.
        
        This operation only creates a proposed escrow transfer. Both the *agent*
        and *to* must agree to the terms of the arrangement by approving the
        escrow.
        
        The escrow agent is paid the fee on approval of all parties. It is up to
        the escrow agent to determine the fee.
        
        Escrow transactions are uniquely identified by `from` and `escrow_id`,
        the `escrow_id` is defined by the sender.

      purpose: |
        Delegate vesting shares from one account to the other. The vesting
        shares are still owned by the original account, but content voting
        rights and bandwidth allocation are transferred to the receiving
        account. This sets the delegation to `vesting_shares`, increasing it or
        decreasing it as needed (i.e. a delegation of 0 removes the delegation).
        
        When a delegation is removed the shares are placed in limbo for a week
        to prevent a satoshi of VESTS from voting on the same content twice.

      purpose: |
        Instead of paying the entire account creation fee with Steem, creators
        can now pay a smaller fee (30x less) and delegate some Steem Power for
        30 days. The exact amount is 5 * min_fee + STEEM_POWER == 150 * min_fee.
        You can pay any combination of STEEM and Steem Power along that curve
        (so long as the minimum fee is paid).

        *The witness voted STEEM fee is now the minimum required STEEM fee for
        delegation. Witnesses should reduce their fee by 30x when the hardfork
        goes live to preserve the same required fee for an all STEEM account
        creation.*
