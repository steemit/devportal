#### Site Resources

The **quickstart** section has some general information on working with nodes, and testnets.

Our **tutorials** section will take you through the basics of interacting with Steem apis in Javascript, Python, and Ruby.

More detailed API specs are available in the **APPBASE API** section. Those apis are under development, so please read 
notes at the top of each section.

You can find community resources, libraries, and more 'human' ways to get help and education in the **communities** section. 

The **glossary** has Steem specific terms that will help you understand documentation, whitepapers, and the speech of other steemians.
