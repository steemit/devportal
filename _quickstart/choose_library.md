Getting started to develop robust and feature rich **steem** applications couldn't be easier. Accessing steem data is easy from various options depending on your infrastructure and objectives. 

Building a picture discovery app is a breeze with the [JavaScript](/tutorials#javascript) library. There is also a [Python](/tutorials#python) library available, [Steemit.com](#services-steemit) and [SBDS](#services-sbds) services, as well as many [third party developer projects](#community-overview) which could be beneficial for your steem project.
