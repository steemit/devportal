Getting started to develop robust and feature rich **steem** applications couldn't be easier. Accessing steem data is easy from various options depending on your infrastructure and objectives.

There is also a [Python](#pythongetting_started) library available, [Steemit.com](#servicessteemit) and [SBDS](#servicessbds) services, as well as many [third party developer projects](#communityoverview) which could be beneficial for your steem project.
