This tutorial runs on the main Steem blockchain. And accounts queried are real users with liquid STEEM balances.

## Intro

This tutorial will show few functions such as querying account by name and getting account balance. We are using the `call` function provided by the `dsteem` library to pull account from the Steem blockchain. A simple HTML interface is used to capture the account and its STEEM balance as well as allowing interactively power up part or all of STEEM to choose account.

## Steps

1.  [**App setup**](#app-setup) Setup `dsteem` to use the proper connection and network.
2.  [**Search account**](#search-account) Get account details after input has account name
3.  [**Fill form**](#fill-form) Fill form with account reward balances
4.  [**Power up**](#power-up) Power up STEEM with Steemlogin or Client-side signing.

#### 1. App setup <a name="app-setup"></a>

Below we have `dsteem` pointing to the production network with the proper chainId, addressPrefix, and endpoint. There is a `public/app.js` file which holds the Javascript segment of this tutorial. In the first few lines we define the configured library and packages:

```javascript
const dsteem = require('dsteem');
let opts = {};
//connect to production server
opts.addressPrefix = 'STM';
opts.chainId =
    '0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000';
//connect to server which is connected to the network/production
const client = new dsteem.Client('https://api.steemit.com');
```

#### 2. Search account <a name="search-account"></a>

After account name field is filled with some name, we do automatic search for account by name when input is focused out. HTML input forms can be found in the `index.html` file. The values are pulled from that screen with the below:

```javascript
    const accSearch = document.getElementById('username').value;
    const _account = await client.database.call('get_accounts', [[accSearch]]);
    console.log(`_account:`, _account);
```

#### 3. Fill form <a name="fill-form"></a>

After we fetched account data, we will fill form with STEEM balance and show current balance details.

```javascript
const name = _account[0].name;
const steem_balance = _account[0].balance;
const balance = `Available Steem balance for ${name}: ${steem_balance}<br/>`;
document.getElementById('accBalance').innerHTML = balance;
document.getElementById('steem').value = steem_balance;
const receiver = document.getElementById('receiver').value;
```

#### 4. Power up <a name="power-up"></a>

We have 2 options on how to Power up. Steemlogin and Client-side signing options. By default we generate Steemlogin link to Power up (transfer to vesting), but you can use client signing option to Power up right inside tutorial, note client-side signing will require Active private key to perform operation.

In order to enable client signing, we will generate operation and also show Active Private key (wif) field to sign transaction right there client side.
Below you can see example of operation and signing transaction, after successful operation broadcast result will be shown in user interface. It will be block number that transaction was included.

```javascript
window.submitTx = async () => {
    const privateKey = dsteem.PrivateKey.fromString(
        document.getElementById('wif').value
    );
    const op = [
        'transfer_to_vesting',
        {
            from: document.getElementById('username').value,
            to: document.getElementById('receiver').value,
            amount: document.getElementById('steem').value,
        },
    ];
    client.broadcast.sendOperations([op], privateKey).then(
        function(result) {
            document.getElementById('result').style.display = 'block';
            document.getElementById(
                'result'
            ).innerHTML = `<br/><p>Included in block: ${
                result.block_num
            }</p><br/><br/>`;
        },
        function(error) {
            console.error(error);
        }
    );
};
```

That's it!
