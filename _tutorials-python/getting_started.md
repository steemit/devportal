The official Steem library for Python is `steem-python`. It comes with a BIP38 encrypted wallet and a practical CLI utility called steempy. 

The library was designed to allow Python developers to easily access the network as well as build utilities and applications. 

Currently `steem-python` documentation is generated in the standard pydoc format. 

Documentation is available at: [Official steem-python Docs](http://steem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/){:target="_blank"}.
