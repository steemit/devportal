<title>Broadcast Ops - Steem Developer</title>
<meta property="og:title" content="Broadcast Ops" />
<meta name="description" content="An operation on Steem is a way of expressing intention on the blockchain. They are also known as Broadcast Operations. They have types, like vote or comment. They pass parameters like author and permlink, depending on what their purpose is. Operations are grouped into transactions and passed as parameters to methods like network_broadcast_api.broadcast_transaction_synchronous, in the operations array. Transactions must be signed in order for the blockchain to accept them. Here is an example of a transaction that contains one operation (shown without signatures). { &quot;jsonrpc&quot;:&quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;method&quot;:&quot;network_broadcast_api.broadcast_transaction_synchronous&quot;, &quot;params&quot;:{ &quot;trx&quot;:{ &quot;ref_block_num&quot;:1097, &quot;ref_block_prefix&quot;:2181793527, &quot;expiration&quot;:&quot;2016-03-24T18:00:21&quot;, &quot;operations&quot;:[ [ &quot;vote&quot;, { &quot;voter&quot;:&quot;steemit&quot;, &quot;author&quot;:&quot;alice&quot;, &quot;permlink&quot;:&quot;a-post-by-alice&quot;, &quot;weight&quot;:10000 } ] ], &quot;extensions&quot;:[], &quot;signatures&quot;:[] } }, &quot;id&quot;:1 } Also see: Network Broadcast API vote This operation is used to cast a vote on a post/comment. The primary purpose of voting is to express Proof-of-Brain about content to the blockchain. When a vote is cast, the content is considered in the consensus rules involving author and curation rewards. An upvote can be cast from the point in time that the content is created up to 6.5 days. The remaining 12 hours are locked out of upvotes at which time only downvotes may be cast. A secondary aspect to voting involves reputation, which is not part of consensus. Reputation Rules: Must have non-negative reputation to effect another user’s reputation. If you are down voting another user, you must have more reputation than them to impact their reputation. Notes: voter: must be a valid account name author: must be a valid account name permlink: must be content created by author weight: absolute value must not be more than 10000 (100.00 %). Roles: posting active owner Parameters: voter author permlink weight Example Op: [ &quot;vote&quot;, { &quot;voter&quot;: &quot;steemit&quot;, &quot;author&quot;: &quot;alice&quot;, &quot;permlink&quot;: &quot;a-post-by-alice&quot;, &quot;weight&quot;: 10000 } ] comment Creates a post/comment. Notes: title: must not be larger than 256 bytes title: must be UTF-8 body: must be larger than 0 bytes body: must be UTF-8 Roles: posting active owner Parameters: parent_author parent_permlink author permlink title body json_metadata Example Op: [ &quot;comment&quot;, { &quot;parent_author&quot;: &quot;&quot;, &quot;parent_permlink&quot;: &quot;steem&quot;, &quot;author&quot;: &quot;alice&quot;, &quot;permlink&quot;: &quot;a-post-by-alice&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;A Post By Alice&quot;, &quot;body&quot;: &quot;This is my post.&quot;, &quot;json_metadata&quot;: &quot;{\&quot;tags\&quot;:[\&quot;steemit\&quot;,\&quot;example\&quot;,\&quot;tags\&quot;]}&quot; } ] transfer Transfers asset from one account to another. The memo is plain-text, any encryption on the memo is up to a higher level protocol. Notes: Transferring of Steem Power (VESTS) is not allowed. Cannot transfer a negative amount (aka: stealing). Memo must be less than 2048 bytes. Memo must be UTF-8. Roles: active owner Parameters: from to amount memo Example Op: [ &quot;transfer&quot;, { &quot;from&quot;: &quot;steemit&quot;, &quot;to&quot;: &quot;alice&quot;, &quot;amount&quot;: { &quot;amount&quot;: &quot;10&quot;, &quot;precision&quot;: 3, &quot;nai&quot;: &quot;@@000000021&quot; }, &quot;memo&quot;: &quot;Thanks for all the fish.&quot; } ] transfer_to_vesting This operation converts STEEM into VFS (Vesting Fund Shares) at the current exchange rate. With this operation it is possible to give another account vesting shares so that faucets can pre-fund new accounts with vesting shares. Notes: Amount must be in STEEM. Must transfer a nonzero amount. Roles: active owner Parameters: from to amount Example Op: [ &quot;transfer_to_vesting&quot;, { &quot;from&quot;: &quot;alice&quot;, &quot;to&quot;: &quot;&quot;, &quot;amount&quot;: { &quot;amount&quot;: &quot;357000&quot;, &quot;precision&quot;: 3, &quot;nai&quot;: &quot;@@000000021&quot; } } ] withdraw_vesting At any given point in time an account can be withdrawing from their vesting shares. A user may change the number of shares they wish to cash out at any time between 0 and their total vesting stake. After applying this operation, vesting_shares will be withdrawn at a rate of vesting_shares/13 per week for 13 weeks starting one week after this operation is included in the blockchain. This operation is not valid if the user has no vesting shares. Notes: Amount must be VESTS. Roles: active owner Parameters: account vesting_shares Example Op: [ &quot;withdraw_vesting&quot;, { &quot;account&quot;: &quot;steemit&quot;, &quot;vesting_shares&quot;: { &quot;amount&quot;: &quot;200000000000&quot;, &quot;precision&quot;: 6, &quot;nai&quot;: &quot;@@000000037&quot; } } ] limit_order_create This operation creates a limit order and matches it against existing open orders. Roles: active owner Parameters: owner orderid amount_to_sell min_to_receive fill_or_kill expiration Example Op: [ &quot;limit_order_create&quot;, { &quot;owner&quot;: &quot;steemit&quot;, &quot;orderid&quot;: 10, &quot;amount_to_sell&quot;: { &quot;amount&quot;: &quot;9950&quot;, &quot;precision&quot;: 3, &quot;nai&quot;: &quot;@@000000021&quot; }, &quot;min_to_receive&quot;: { &quot;amount&quot;: &quot;3500&quot;, &quot;precision&quot;: 3, &quot;nai&quot;: &quot;@@000000013&quot; }, &quot;fill_or_kill&quot;: false, &quot;expiration&quot;: &quot;2035-10-29T06:32:22&quot; } ] limit_order_cancel Cancels an order and returns the balance to owner. Roles: active owner Parameters: owner orderid Example Op: [ &quot;limit_order_cancel&quot;, {&quot;owner&quot;: &quot;steemit&quot;, &quot;orderid&quot;: 10} ] price Roles: active owner Parameters: base quote feed_publish Feeds can only be published by the top N witnesses which are included in every round and are used to define the exchange rate between steem and the dollar. Roles: active owner Parameters: publisher exchange_rate Example Op: [ &quot;feed_publish&quot;, { &quot;publisher&quot;: &quot;alice&quot;, &quot;exchange_rate&quot;: { &quot;base&quot;: { &quot;amount&quot;: &quot;1000&quot;, &quot;precision&quot;: 3, &quot;nai&quot;: &quot;@@000000013&quot; }, &quot;quote&quot;: { &quot;amount&quot;: &quot;1000000&quot;, &quot;precision&quot;: 3, &quot;nai&quot;: &quot;@@000000021&quot; } } } ] convert This operation instructs the blockchain to start a conversion between STEEM and SBD, the funds are deposited after 3.5 days. Roles: active owner Parameters: owner requestid amount Example Op: [ &quot;convert&quot;, { &quot;owner&quot;: &quot;steemit&quot;, &quot;requestid&quot;: 1467592156, &quot;amount&quot;: { &quot;amount&quot;: &quot;5000&quot;, &quot;precision&quot;: 3, &quot;nai&quot;: &quot;@@000000013&quot; } } ] account_create Roles: active owner Parameters: fee creator new_account_name owner active posting memo_key json_metadata Example Op: [ &quot;account_create&quot;, { &quot;fee&quot;: { &quot;amount&quot;: &quot;0&quot;, &quot;precision&quot;: 3, &quot;nai&quot;: &quot;@@000000021&quot; }, &quot;creator&quot;: &quot;steemit&quot;, &quot;new_account_name&quot;: &quot;alice&quot;, &quot;owner&quot;: { &quot;weight_threshold&quot;: 1, &quot;account_auths&quot;: [], &quot;key_auths&quot;: [ [ &quot;STM5b4i9gBqvh4sbgrooXPu2dbGLewNPZkXeuNeBjyiswnu2szgXx&quot;, 1 ] ] }, &quot;active&quot;: { &quot;weight_threshold&quot;: 1, &quot;account_auths&quot;: [], &quot;key_auths&quot;: [ [ &quot;STM7ko5nzqaYfjbD4tKWGmiy3xtT9eQFZ3Pcmq5JmygTRptWSiVQy&quot;, 1 ] ] }, &quot;posting&quot;: { &quot;weight_threshold&quot;: 1, &quot;account_auths&quot;: [], &quot;key_auths&quot;: [ [ &quot;STM5xAKxnMT2y9VoVJdF63K8xRQAohsiQy9bA33aHeyMB5vgkzaay&quot;, 1 ] ] }, &quot;memo_key&quot;: &quot;STM8ZSyzjPm48GmUuMSRufkVYkwYbZzbxeMysAVp7KFQwbTf98TcG&quot;, &quot;json_metadata&quot;: &quot;{}&quot; } ] account_update Roles: active owner Parameters: account owner active posting memo_key json_metadata Example Op: [ &quot;account_update&quot;, { &quot;account&quot;: &quot;steemit&quot;, &quot;posting&quot;: { &quot;weight_threshold&quot;: 1, &quot;account_auths&quot;: [], &quot;key_auths&quot;: [ [ &quot;STM6FATHLohxTN8RWWkU9ZZwVywXo6MEDjHHui1jEBYkG2tTdvMYo&quot;, 1 ], [ &quot;STM76EQNV2RTA6yF9TnBvGSV71mW7eW36MM7XQp24JxdoArTfKA76&quot;, 1 ] ] }, &quot;memo_key&quot;: &quot;STM6FATHLohxTN8RWWkU9ZZwVywXo6MEDjHHui1jEBYkG2tTdvMYo&quot;, &quot;json_metadata&quot;: &quot;&quot; } ] Disabled report_over_production Disabled in HF4 This operation is used to report a miner who signs two blocks at the same time. To be valid, the violation must be reported within STEEM_MAX_WITNESSES blocks of the head block (1 round) and the producer must be in the ACTIVE witness set. Users not in the ACTIVE witness set should not have to worry about their key getting compromised and being used to produced multiple blocks so the attacker can report it and steel their vesting steem. The result of the operation is to transfer the full VESTING STEEM balance of the block producer to the reporter. Roles: active owner Parameters: reporter first_block second_block witness_update Users who wish to become a witness must pay a fee acceptable to the current witnesses to apply for the position and allow voting to begin. If the owner isn’t a witness they will become a witness. Witnesses are charged a fee equal to 1 weeks worth of witness pay which in turn is derived from the current share supply. The fee is only applied if the owner is not already a witness. If the block_signing_key is null then the witness is removed from contention. The network will pick the top 21 witnesses for producing blocks. Notes: The fee paid to register a new witness, should be 10x current block production pay. url cannot be more than 2048 bytes. url must be UTF-8. fee cannot be negative. Roles: active owner Parameters: owner url block_signing_key props fee Example Op: [ &quot;witness_update&quot;, { &quot;owner&quot;: &quot;alice&quot;, &quot;url&quot;: &quot;witness-category/my-witness&quot;, &quot;block_signing_key&quot;: &quot;STM8LoQjQqJHvotqBo7HjnqmUbFW9oJ2theyqonzUd9DdJ7YYHsvD&quot;, &quot;props&quot;: { &quot;account_creation_fee&quot;: { &quot;amount&quot;: &quot;100000&quot;, &quot;precision&quot;: 3, &quot;nai&quot;: &quot;@@000000021&quot; }, &quot;maximum_block_size&quot;: 131072, &quot;sbd_interest_rate&quot;: 1000 }, &quot;fee&quot;: { &quot;amount&quot;: &quot;0&quot;, &quot;precision&quot;: 3, &quot;nai&quot;: &quot;@@000000021&quot; } } ] account_witness_vote All accounts with a VFS (Vesting Fund Shares) can vote for or against any witness. If a proxy is specified then all existing votes are removed. Roles: active owner Parameters: account witness approve Example Op: [ &quot;account_witness_vote&quot;, { &quot;account&quot;: &quot;alice&quot;, &quot;witness&quot;: &quot;bob&quot;, &quot;approve&quot;: true } ] account_witness_proxy Roles: active owner Parameters: account proxy Example Op: [ &quot;account_witness_proxy&quot;, {&quot;account&quot;: &quot;alice&quot;, &quot;proxy&quot;: &quot;bob&quot;} ] Disabled pow Disabled in HF14. Roles: active owner Parameters: worker input signature work Example Op: [ &quot;pow&quot;, { &quot;worker_account&quot;: &quot;admin&quot;, &quot;block_id&quot;: &quot;000004433bd4602cf5f74dbb564183837df9cef8&quot;, &quot;nonce&quot;: 82, &quot;work&quot;: { &quot;worker&quot;: &quot;STM65wH1LZ7BfSHcK69SShnqCAH5xdoSZpGkUjmzHJ5GCuxEK9V5G&quot;, &quot;input&quot;: &quot;59b009f89477919f95914151cef06f28bf344dd6fb7670aca1c1f4323c80446b&quot;, &quot;signature&quot;: &quot;1f3f83209097efcd01b7d6f27ce726164323d503d6fcf4d55bfb7cb3032796f6766738b36062b5850d69447fdf9c091cbc70825df5eeacc4710a0b11ffdbf0912a&quot;, &quot;work&quot;: &quot;0b62f4837801cd857f01d6a541faeb13d6bb95f1c36c6b4b14a47df632aa6c92&quot; }, &quot;props&quot;: { &quot;account_creation_fee&quot;: { &quot;amount&quot;: &quot;100000&quot;, &quot;precision&quot;: 3, &quot;nai&quot;: &quot;@@000000021&quot; }, &quot;maximum_block_size&quot;: 131072, &quot;sbd_interest_rate&quot;: 1000 } } ] custom Provides a generic way to add higher level protocols on top of witness consensus. There is no validation for this operation other than that required auths are valid. Roles: active owner Parameters: required_auths id data Example Op: [ &quot;custom&quot;, { &quot;required_auths&quot;: [&quot;bytemaster&quot;], &quot;id&quot;: 777, &quot;data&quot;: &quot;0a627974656d617374657207737465656d697402a3d13897d82114466ad87a74b73a53292d8331d1bd1d3082da6bfbcff19ed097029db013797711c88cccca3692407f9ff9b9ce7221aaa2d797f1692be2215d0a5f6d2a8cab6832050078bc5729201e3ea24ea9f7873e6dbdc65a6bd9899053b9acda876dc69f11a13df9ca8b26b6&quot; } ] delete_comment Roles: posting active owner Parameters: author permlink Example Op: [ &quot;delete_comment&quot;, { &quot;author&quot;: &quot;alice&quot;, &quot;permlink&quot;: &quot;a-post-by-alice&quot; } ] custom_json Serves the same purpose as custom but also supports required posting authorities. Unlike custom, this operation is designed to be human readable/developer friendly. follow As of HF9, the follow plugin will track follow/unfollow/ignore events. reblog As of HF14, allows users to share blogs they find with those who follow them. This change implemented entirely outside the blockchain consensus which means that reblogging does not create a new post, it merely shares an existing post with people who follow you. witness As of HF18, the witness plugin has a custom operation called enable_content_editing that allows a user to signal they want to edit their content. By consensus, content is editable indefinitely, but is soft forked to be frozen after payout. This operation requires an active key and is designed to prevent vandalism if a posting key is compromised. #1017 Roles: posting active owner Parameters: required_auths required_posting_auths id json Example Op: [ &quot;custom_json&quot;, { &quot;required_auths&quot;: [], &quot;required_posting_auths&quot;: [&quot;steemit&quot;], &quot;id&quot;: &quot;follow&quot;, &quot;json&quot;: &quot;[\&quot;follow\&quot;,{\&quot;follower\&quot;:\&quot;steemit\&quot;,\&quot;following\&quot;:\&quot;alice\&quot;,\&quot;what\&quot;:[\&quot;blog\&quot;]}]&quot; } ] [ &quot;custom_json&quot;, { &quot;required_auths&quot;: [], &quot;required_posting_auths&quot;: [&quot;alice&quot;], &quot;id&quot;: &quot;follow&quot;, &quot;json&quot;: &quot;[\&quot;follow\&quot;,{\&quot;follower\&quot;:\&quot;alice\&quot;,\&quot;following\&quot;:\&quot;eve\&quot;,\&quot;what\&quot;:[\&quot;ignore\&quot;]}]&quot; } ] [ &quot;custom_json&quot;, { &quot;required_auths&quot;: [], &quot;required_posting_auths&quot;: [&quot;bob&quot;], &quot;id&quot;: &quot;reblog&quot;, &quot;json&quot;: &quot;{\&quot;account\&quot;:\&quot;bob\&quot;,\&quot;author\&quot;:\&quot;alice\&quot;,\&quot;permlink\&quot;:\&quot;a-post-by-alice\&quot;}&quot; } ] [ &quot;custom_json&quot;, { &quot;required_auths&quot;: [&quot;alice&quot;], &quot;required_posting_auths&quot;: [], &quot;id&quot;: &quot;witness&quot;, &quot;json&quot;: &quot;[\&quot;enable_content_editing\&quot;, {\&quot;account\&quot;: \&quot;alice\&quot;, \&quot;relock_time\&quot;: \&quot;2100-01-01T12:00:00\&quot;}]&quot; } ] comment_options Authors of posts may not want all of the benefits that come from creating a post. This operation allows authors to update properties associated with their post. Typically, these options will accompany a comment operation in the same transaction. As of HF17, content can specify beneficiaries to receive a part of their author rewards. The beneficiaries are specified in the extension field of the comment_options_operation and is a sorted vector (by account name) of account name, weight pairs. The beneficiaries can only be specified once and must be specified before any votes are cast on the comment. Most apps are already adding a comment_options in the transaction that creates the comment, so this should not be much of a challenge to add to existing apps. Notes: The max_accepted_payout may be decreased, but never increased. The percent_steem_dollars may be decreased, but never increased. Part of comment_option validation process, to be called when allowed_vote_assets object has been added as comment option extension are: When votable assets are greater than maximum votable assets: “Too much votable assets specified” When the symbol is not allowed in the list for votable assets: “STEEM can not be explicitly specified as one of allowed_vote_assets” max_accepted_payout: SBD value of the maximum payout this post will receive percent_steem_dollars: the percent of Steem Dollars to key, unkept amounts will be received as Steem Power allow_votes: allows/disallows a post to receive votes; allow_curation_rewards: allows/disllows voters to recieve curation rewards. Rewards return to reward fund. beneficiaries Must have at least one (empty beneficiaries not allowed). Cannot have more than 127 (witness currently only allow up to 8). Cannot allocate more than 100% of rewards to one account. Cannot allocate more than 100% of rewards to a comment. Must be specified in sorted order (account ascending; no duplicates).

In addition, those funds can be immediately vested again, circumventing the conversion from vests to steem and back, guaranteeing they maintain their value. Notes: Percent must be valid steem percent.

Roles: posting active owner Parameters: challenger challenged require_owner prove_authority Roles: active owner Parameters: challenged require_owner Since: HF11 request_account_recovery All account recovery requests come from a listed recovery account. This is secure based on the assumption that only a trusted account should be a recovery account. It is the responsibility of the recovery account to verify the identity of the account holder of the account to recover by whichever means they have agreed upon. The blockchain assumes identity has been verified when this operation is broadcast. This operation creates an account recovery request which the account to recover has 24 hours to respond to before the request expires and is invalidated. There can only be one active recovery request per account at any one time. Pushing this operation for an account to recover when it already has an active request will either update the request to a new new owner authority and extend the request expiration to 24 hours from the current head block time or it will delete the request. To cancel a request, simply set the weight threshold of the new owner authority to 0, making it an open authority. Additionally, the new owner authority must be satisfiable. In other words, the sum of the key weights must be greater than or equal to the weight threshold. This operation only needs to be signed by the the recovery account. The account to recover confirms its identity to the blockchain in the recover account operation. Notes: recovery_account: The recovery account is listed as the recovery account on the account to recover. account_to_recover: The account to recover. This is likely due to a compromised owner authority. new_owner_authority: The new owner authority the account to recover wishes to have.

The recovery account has the ability to create account_recovery_requests for the account to recover. An account can change their recovery account at any time with a 30 day delay. This delay is to prevent an attacker from changing the recovery account to a malicious account during an attack. These 30 days match the 30 days that an owner authority is valid for recovery purposes. On account creation the recovery account is set either to the creator of the account (The account that pays the creation fee and is a signer on the transaction) or to the empty string if the account was mined. An account with no recovery has the top voted witness as a recovery account, at the time the recover request is created. Note: This does mean the effective recovery account of an account with no listed recovery account can change at any time as witness vote weights. The top voted witness is explicitly the most trusted witness according to stake. See: #169 Roles: owner Parameters: account_to_recover new_recovery_account extensions Example Op: [ &quot;change_recovery_account&quot;, { &quot;account_to_recover&quot;: &quot;alice&quot;, &quot;new_recovery_account&quot;: &quot;bob&quot;, &quot;extensions&quot;: [] } ] Since: HF14 escrow_transfer The purpose of this operation is to enable someone to send money contingently to another individual. The funds leave the from account and go into a temporary balance where they are held until from releases it to to or to refunds it to from. In the event of a dispute the agent can divide the funds between the to/from account. Disputes can be raised any time before or on the dispute deadline time, after the escrow has been approved by all parties. This operation only creates a proposed escrow transfer. Both the agent and to must agree to the terms of the arrangement by approving the escrow. The escrow agent is paid the fee on approval of all parties. It is up to the escrow agent to determine the fee. Escrow transactions are uniquely identified by from and escrow_id, the escrow_id is defined by the sender.

The permission scheme is as follows: If there is no dispute and escrow has not expired, either party can release funds to the other. If escrow expires and there is no dispute, either party can release funds to either party. If there is a dispute regardless of expiration, the agent can release funds to either party following whichever agreement was in place between the parties.

The vesting shares are still owned by the original account, but content voting rights and bandwidth allocation are transferred to the receiving account. This sets the delegation to vesting_shares, increasing it or decreasing it as needed (i.e. a delegation of 0 removes the delegation). When a delegation is removed the shares are placed in limbo for a week to prevent a satoshi of VESTS from voting on the same content twice.

The exact amount is 5 * min_fee + STEEM_POWER == 150 * min_fee. You can pay any combination of STEEM and Steem Power along that curve (so long as the minimum fee is paid). The witness voted STEEM fee is now the minimum required STEEM fee for delegation.

<meta property="og:description" content="An operation on Steem is a way of expressing intention on the blockchain. They are also known as Broadcast Operations. They have types, like vote or comment. They pass parameters like author and permlink, depending on what their purpose is. Operations are grouped into transactions and passed as parameters to methods like network_broadcast_api.broadcast_transaction_synchronous, in the operations array. Transactions must be signed in order for the blockchain to accept them. Here is an example of a transaction that contains one operation (shown without signatures). { &quot;jsonrpc&quot;:&quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;method&quot;:&quot;network_broadcast_api.broadcast_transaction_synchronous&quot;, &quot;params&quot;:{ &quot;trx&quot;:{ &quot;ref_block_num&quot;:1097, &quot;ref_block_prefix&quot;:2181793527, &quot;expiration&quot;:&quot;2016-03-24T18:00:21&quot;, &quot;operations&quot;:[ [ &quot;vote&quot;, { &quot;voter&quot;:&quot;steemit&quot;, &quot;author&quot;:&quot;alice&quot;, &quot;permlink&quot;:&quot;a-post-by-alice&quot;, &quot;weight&quot;:10000 } ] ], &quot;extensions&quot;:[], &quot;signatures&quot;:[] } }, &quot;id&quot;:1 } Also see: Network Broadcast API vote This operation is used to cast a vote on a post/comment. The primary purpose of voting is to express Proof-of-Brain about content to the blockchain. When a vote is cast, the content is considered in the consensus rules involving author and curation rewards. An upvote can be cast from the point in time that the content is created up to 6.5 days. The remaining 12 hours are locked out of upvotes at which time only downvotes may be cast. A secondary aspect to voting involves reputation, which is not part of consensus. Reputation Rules: Must have non-negative reputation to effect another user’s reputation. If you are down voting another user, you must have more reputation than them to impact their reputation.

To be valid, the violation must be reported within STEEM_MAX_WITNESSES blocks of the head block (1 round) and the producer must be in the ACTIVE witness set. Users not in the ACTIVE witness set should not have to worry about their key getting compromised and being used to produced multiple blocks so the attacker can report it and steel their vesting steem. The result of the operation is to transfer the full VESTING STEEM balance of the block producer to the reporter. Roles: active owner Parameters: reporter first_block second_block witness_update Users who wish to become a witness must pay a fee acceptable to the current witnesses to apply for the position and allow voting to begin. If the owner isn’t a witness they will become a witness. Witnesses are charged a fee equal to 1 weeks worth of witness pay which in turn is derived from the current share supply. The fee is only applied if the owner is not already a witness. If the block_signing_key is null then the witness is removed from contention. The network will pick the top 21 witnesses for producing blocks. Notes: The fee paid to register a new witness, should be 10x current block production pay. url cannot be more than 2048 bytes. url must be UTF-8. fee cannot be negative.

Unlike custom, this operation is designed to be human readable/developer friendly. follow As of HF9, the follow plugin will track follow/unfollow/ignore events. reblog As of HF14, allows users to share blogs they find with those who follow them. This change implemented entirely outside the blockchain consensus which means that reblogging does not create a new post, it merely shares an existing post with people who follow you. witness As of HF18, the witness plugin has a custom operation called enable_content_editing that allows a user to signal they want to edit their content. By consensus, content is editable indefinitely, but is soft forked to be frozen after payout.

This operation allows authors to update properties associated with their post. Typically, these options will accompany a comment operation in the same transaction. As of HF17, content can specify beneficiaries to receive a part of their author rewards. The beneficiaries are specified in the extension field of the comment_options_operation and is a sorted vector (by account name) of account name, weight pairs. The beneficiaries can only be specified once and must be specified before any votes are cast on the comment. Most apps are already adding a comment_options in the transaction that creates the comment, so this should not be much of a challenge to add to existing apps.

Roles: posting active owner Parameters: challenger challenged require_owner prove_authority Roles: active owner Parameters: challenged require_owner Since: HF11 request_account_recovery All account recovery requests come from a listed recovery account. This is secure based on the assumption that only a trusted account should be a recovery account. It is the responsibility of the recovery account to verify the identity of the account holder of the account to recover by whichever means they have agreed upon. The blockchain assumes identity has been verified when this operation is broadcast. This operation creates an account recovery request which the account to recover has 24 hours to respond to before the request expires and is invalidated. There can only be one active recovery request per account at any one time. Pushing this operation for an account to recover when it already has an active request will either update the request to a new new owner authority and extend the request expiration to 24 hours from the current head block time or it will delete the request. To cancel a request, simply set the weight threshold of the new owner authority to 0, making it an open authority. Additionally, the new owner authority must be satisfiable. In other words, the sum of the key weights must be greater than or equal to the weight threshold. This operation only needs to be signed by the the recovery account. The account to recover confirms its identity to the blockchain in the recover account operation. Notes: recovery_account: The recovery account is listed as the recovery account on the account to recover. account_to_recover: The account to recover. This is likely due to a compromised owner authority. new_owner_authority: The new owner authority the account to recover wishes to have. This is secret known by the account to recover and will be confirmed in a recover_account.

The recovery account has the ability to create account_recovery_requests for the account to recover. An account can change their recovery account at any time with a 30 day delay. This delay is to prevent an attacker from changing the recovery account to a malicious account during an attack. These 30 days match the 30 days that an owner authority is valid for recovery purposes. On account creation the recovery account is set either to the creator of the account (The account that pays the creation fee and is a signer on the transaction) or to the empty string if the account was mined. An account with no recovery has the top voted witness as a recovery account, at the time the recover request is created. Note: This does mean the effective recovery account of an account with no listed recovery account can change at any time as witness vote weights. The top voted witness is explicitly the most trusted witness according to stake.

The funds leave the from account and go into a temporary balance where they are held until from releases it to to or to refunds it to from. In the event of a dispute the agent can divide the funds between the to/from account. Disputes can be raised any time before or on the dispute deadline time, after the escrow has been approved by all parties. This operation only creates a proposed escrow transfer. Both the agent and to must agree to the terms of the arrangement by approving the escrow. The escrow agent is paid the fee on approval of all parties. It is up to the escrow agent to determine the fee. Escrow transactions are uniquely identified by from and escrow_id, the escrow_id is defined by the sender.

The json deserialization has a non-trivial cost associated with it. This operation will allow for binary deserialization of plugin operations and should improve overall performance of plugins that chose to use it. See: steem_operations.hpp:491 Roles: posting active owner Parameters: id data Since: HF14 decline_voting_rights An account can chose to decline their voting rights after a 30 day delay. This includes voting on content and witnesses. The voting rights cannot be acquired again once they have been declined. This is only to formalize a smart contract between certain accounts and the community that currently only exists as a social contract.

See: #169 Roles: active owner Parameters: reset_account account_to_reset new_owner_authority Since: HF11 Disabled set_reset_account This operation allows account owner to control which account has the power to execute the reset_account operation after 60 days.

The vesting shares are still owned by the original account, but content voting rights and bandwidth allocation are transferred to the receiving account. This sets the delegation to vesting_shares, increasing it or decreasing it as needed (i.e. a delegation of 0 removes the delegation). When a delegation is removed the shares are placed in limbo for a week to prevent a satoshi of VESTS from voting on the same content twice. Also see: steem_evaluator.cpp:2309 Roles: active owner Parameters: delegator delegatee vesting_shares Example Op: [ &quot;delegate_vesting_shares&quot;, { &quot;delegator&quot;: &quot;alice&quot;, &quot;delegatee&quot;: &quot;bob&quot;, &quot;vesting_shares&quot;: { &quot;amount&quot;: &quot;94599167138276&quot;, &quot;precision&quot;: 6, &quot;nai&quot;: &quot;@@000000037&quot; } } ] Since: HF17 account_create_with_delegation Instead of paying the entire account creation fee with Steem, creators can now pay a smaller fee (30x less) and delegate some Steem Power for 30 days. The exact amount is 5 * min_fee + STEEM_POWER == 150 * min_fee. You can pay any combination of STEEM and Steem Power along that curve (so long as the minimum fee is paid). The witness voted STEEM fee is now the minimum required STEEM fee for delegation. Witnesses should reduce their fee by 30x when the hardfork goes live to preserve the same required fee for an all STEEM account creation.

"description": "An operation on Steem is a way of expressing intention on the blockchain. They are also known as Broadcast Operations. They have types, like vote or comment. They pass parameters like author and permlink, depending on what their purpose is. Operations are grouped into transactions and passed as parameters to methods like network_broadcast_api.broadcast_transaction_synchronous, in the operations array. Transactions must be signed in order for the blockchain to accept them. Here is an example of a transaction that contains one operation (shown without signatures). { &quot;jsonrpc&quot;:&quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;method&quot;:&quot;network_broadcast_api.broadcast_transaction_synchronous&quot;, &quot;params&quot;:{ &quot;trx&quot;:{ &quot;ref_block_num&quot;:1097, &quot;ref_block_prefix&quot;:2181793527, &quot;expiration&quot;:&quot;2016-03-24T18:00:21&quot;, &quot;operations&quot;:[ [ &quot;vote&quot;, { &quot;voter&quot;:&quot;steemit&quot;, &quot;author&quot;:&quot;alice&quot;, &quot;permlink&quot;:&quot;a-post-by-alice&quot;, &quot;weight&quot;:10000 } ] ], &quot;extensions&quot;:[], &quot;signatures&quot;:[] } }, &quot;id&quot;:1 } Also see: Network Broadcast API vote This operation is used to cast a vote on a post/comment. The primary purpose of voting is to express Proof-of-Brain about content to the blockchain. When a vote is cast, the content is considered in the consensus rules involving author and curation rewards. An upvote can be cast from the point in time that the content is created up to 6.5 days. The remaining 12 hours are locked out of upvotes at which time only downvotes may be cast. A secondary aspect to voting involves reputation, which is not part of consensus. Reputation Rules: Must have non-negative reputation to effect another user’s reputation. If you are down voting another user, you must have more reputation than them to impact their reputation. Notes: voter: must be a valid account name author: must be a valid account name permlink: must be content created by author weight: absolute value must not be more than 10000 (100.00 %). Roles: posting active owner Parameters: voter author permlink weight Example Op: [ &quot;vote&quot;, { &quot;voter&quot;: &quot;steemit&quot;, &quot;author&quot;: &quot;alice&quot;, &quot;permlink&quot;: &quot;a-post-by-alice&quot;, &quot;weight&quot;: 10000 } ] comment Creates a post/comment. Notes: title: must not be larger than 256 bytes title: must be UTF-8 body: must be larger than 0 bytes body: must be UTF-8 Roles: posting active owner Parameters: parent_author parent_permlink author permlink title body json_metadata Example Op: [ &quot;comment&quot;, { &quot;parent_author&quot;: &quot;&quot;, &quot;parent_permlink&quot;: &quot;steem&quot;, &quot;author&quot;: &quot;alice&quot;, &quot;permlink&quot;: &quot;a-post-by-alice&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;A Post By Alice&quot;, &quot;body&quot;: &quot;This is my post.&quot;, &quot;json_metadata&quot;: &quot;{\\&quot;tags\\&quot;:[\\&quot;steemit\\&quot;,\\&quot;example\\&quot;,\\&quot;tags\\&quot;]}&quot; } ] transfer Transfers asset from one account to another. The memo is plain-text, any encryption on the memo is up to a higher level protocol. Notes: Transferring of Steem Power (VESTS) is not allowed. Cannot transfer a negative amount (aka: stealing). Memo must be less than 2048 bytes. Memo must be UTF-8. Roles: active owner Parameters: from to amount memo Example Op: [ &quot;transfer&quot;, { &quot;from&quot;: &quot;steemit&quot;, &quot;to&quot;: &quot;alice&quot;, &quot;amount&quot;: { &quot;amount&quot;: &quot;10&quot;, &quot;precision&quot;: 3, &quot;nai&quot;: &quot;@@000000021&quot; }, &quot;memo&quot;: &quot;Thanks for all the fish.&quot; } ] transfer_to_vesting This operation converts STEEM into VFS (Vesting Fund Shares) at the current exchange rate. With this operation it is possible to give another account vesting shares so that faucets can pre-fund new accounts with vesting shares. Notes: Amount must be in STEEM. Must transfer a nonzero amount. Roles: active owner Parameters: from to amount Example Op: [ &quot;transfer_to_vesting&quot;, { &quot;from&quot;: &quot;alice&quot;, &quot;to&quot;: &quot;&quot;, &quot;amount&quot;: { &quot;amount&quot;: &quot;357000&quot;, &quot;precision&quot;: 3, &quot;nai&quot;: &quot;@@000000021&quot; } } ] withdraw_vesting At any given point in time an account can be withdrawing from their vesting shares. A user may change the number of shares they wish to cash out at any time between 0 and their total vesting stake. After applying this operation, vesting_shares will be withdrawn at a rate of vesting_shares/13 per week for 13 weeks starting one week after this operation is included in the blockchain. This operation is not valid if the user has no vesting shares. Notes: Amount must be VESTS. Roles: active owner Parameters: account vesting_shares Example Op: [ &quot;withdraw_vesting&quot;, { &quot;account&quot;: &quot;steemit&quot;, &quot;vesting_shares&quot;: { &quot;amount&quot;: &quot;200000000000&quot;, &quot;precision&quot;: 6, &quot;nai&quot;: &quot;@@000000037&quot; } } ] limit_order_create This operation creates a limit order and matches it against existing open orders. Roles: active owner Parameters: owner orderid amount_to_sell min_to_receive fill_or_kill expiration Example Op: [ &quot;limit_order_create&quot;, { &quot;owner&quot;: &quot;steemit&quot;, &quot;orderid&quot;: 10, &quot;amount_to_sell&quot;: { &quot;amount&quot;: &quot;9950&quot;, &quot;precision&quot;: 3, &quot;nai&quot;: &quot;@@000000021&quot; }, &quot;min_to_receive&quot;: { &quot;amount&quot;: &quot;3500&quot;, &quot;precision&quot;: 3, &quot;nai&quot;: &quot;@@000000013&quot; }, &quot;fill_or_kill&quot;: false, &quot;expiration&quot;: &quot;2035-10-29T06:32:22&quot; } ] limit_order_cancel Cancels an order and returns the balance to owner. Roles: active owner Parameters: owner orderid Example Op: [ &quot;limit_order_cancel&quot;, {&quot;owner&quot;: &quot;steemit&quot;, &quot;orderid&quot;: 10} ] price Roles: active owner Parameters: base quote feed_publish Feeds can only be published by the top N witnesses which are included in every round and are used to define the exchange rate between steem and the dollar. Roles: active owner Parameters: publisher exchange_rate Example Op: [ &quot;feed_publish&quot;, { &quot;publisher&quot;: &quot;alice&quot;, &quot;exchange_rate&quot;: { &quot;base&quot;: { &quot;amount&quot;: &quot;1000&quot;, &quot;precision&quot;: 3, &quot;nai&quot;: &quot;@@000000013&quot; }, &quot;quote&quot;: { &quot;amount&quot;: &quot;1000000&quot;, &quot;precision&quot;: 3, &quot;nai&quot;: &quot;@@000000021&quot; } } } ] convert This operation instructs the blockchain to start a conversion between STEEM and SBD, the funds are deposited after 3.5 days. Roles: active owner Parameters: owner requestid amount Example Op: [ &quot;convert&quot;, { &quot;owner&quot;: &quot;steemit&quot;, &quot;requestid&quot;: 1467592156, &quot;amount&quot;: { &quot;amount&quot;: &quot;5000&quot;, &quot;precision&quot;: 3, &quot;nai&quot;: &quot;@@000000013&quot; } } ] account_create Roles: active owner Parameters: fee creator new_account_name owner active posting memo_key json_metadata Example Op: [ &quot;account_create&quot;, { &quot;fee&quot;: { &quot;amount&quot;: &quot;0&quot;, &quot;precision&quot;: 3, &quot;nai&quot;: &quot;@@000000021&quot; }, &quot;creator&quot;: &quot;steemit&quot;, &quot;new_account_name&quot;: &quot;alice&quot;, &quot;owner&quot;: { &quot;weight_threshold&quot;: 1, &quot;account_auths&quot;: [], &quot;key_auths&quot;: [ [ &quot;STM5b4i9gBqvh4sbgrooXPu2dbGLewNPZkXeuNeBjyiswnu2szgXx&quot;, 1 ] ] }, &quot;active&quot;: { &quot;weight_threshold&quot;: 1, &quot;account_auths&quot;: [], &quot;key_auths&quot;: [ [ &quot;STM7ko5nzqaYfjbD4tKWGmiy3xtT9eQFZ3Pcmq5JmygTRptWSiVQy&quot;, 1 ] ] }, &quot;posting&quot;: { &quot;weight_threshold&quot;: 1, &quot;account_auths&quot;: [], &quot;key_auths&quot;: [ [ &quot;STM5xAKxnMT2y9VoVJdF63K8xRQAohsiQy9bA33aHeyMB5vgkzaay&quot;, 1 ] ] }, &quot;memo_key&quot;: &quot;STM8ZSyzjPm48GmUuMSRufkVYkwYbZzbxeMysAVp7KFQwbTf98TcG&quot;, &quot;json_metadata&quot;: &quot;{}&quot; } ] account_update Roles: active owner Parameters: account owner active posting memo_key json_metadata Example Op: [ &quot;account_update&quot;, { &quot;account&quot;: &quot;steemit&quot;, &quot;posting&quot;: { &quot;weight_threshold&quot;: 1, &quot;account_auths&quot;: [], &quot;key_auths&quot;: [ [ &quot;STM6FATHLohxTN8RWWkU9ZZwVywXo6MEDjHHui1jEBYkG2tTdvMYo&quot;, 1 ], [ &quot;STM76EQNV2RTA6yF9TnBvGSV71mW7eW36MM7XQp24JxdoArTfKA76&quot;, 1 ] ] }, &quot;memo_key&quot;: &quot;STM6FATHLohxTN8RWWkU9ZZwVywXo6MEDjHHui1jEBYkG2tTdvMYo&quot;, &quot;json_metadata&quot;: &quot;&quot; } ] Disabled report_over_production Disabled in HF4 This operation is used to report a miner who signs two blocks at the same time. To be valid, the violation must be reported within STEEM_MAX_WITNESSES blocks of the head block (1 round) and the producer must be in the ACTIVE witness set. Users not in the ACTIVE witness set should not have to worry about their key getting compromised and being used to produced multiple blocks so the attacker can report it and steel their vesting steem. The result of the operation is to transfer the full VESTING STEEM balance of the block producer to the reporter. Roles: active owner Parameters: reporter first_block second_block witness_update Users who wish to become a witness must pay a fee acceptable to the current witnesses to apply for the position and allow voting to begin. If the owner isn’t a witness they will become a witness. Witnesses are charged a fee equal to 1 weeks worth of witness pay which in turn is derived from the current share supply. The fee is only applied if the owner is not already a witness. If the block_signing_key is null then the witness is removed from contention. The network will pick the top 21 witnesses for producing blocks. Notes: The fee paid to register a new witness, should be 10x current block production pay. url cannot be more than 2048 bytes. url must be UTF-8. fee cannot be negative. Roles: active owner Parameters: owner url block_signing_key props fee Example Op: [ &quot;witness_update&quot;, { &quot;owner&quot;: &quot;alice&quot;, &quot;url&quot;: &quot;witness-category/my-witness&quot;, &quot;block_signing_key&quot;: &quot;STM8LoQjQqJHvotqBo7HjnqmUbFW9oJ2theyqonzUd9DdJ7YYHsvD&quot;, &quot;props&quot;: { &quot;account_creation_fee&quot;: { &quot;amount&quot;: &quot;100000&quot;, &quot;precision&quot;: 3, &quot;nai&quot;: &quot;@@000000021&quot; }, &quot;maximum_block_size&quot;: 131072, &quot;sbd_interest_rate&quot;: 1000 }, &quot;fee&quot;: { &quot;amount&quot;: &quot;0&quot;, &quot;precision&quot;: 3, &quot;nai&quot;: &quot;@@000000021&quot; } } ] account_witness_vote All accounts with a VFS (Vesting Fund Shares) can vote for or against any witness. If a proxy is specified then all existing votes are removed.

Unlike custom, this operation is designed to be human readable/developer friendly. follow As of HF9, the follow plugin will track follow/unfollow/ignore events. reblog As of HF14, allows users to share blogs they find with those who follow them. This change implemented entirely outside the blockchain consensus which means that reblogging does not create a new post, it merely shares an existing post with people who follow you. witness As of HF18, the witness plugin has a custom operation called enable_content_editing that allows a user to signal they want to edit their content. By consensus, content is editable indefinitely, but is soft forked to be frozen after payout. This operation requires an active key and is designed to prevent vandalism if a posting key is compromised. #1017 Roles: posting active owner Parameters: required_auths required_posting_auths id json Example Op: [ &quot;custom_json&quot;, { &quot;required_auths&quot;: [], &quot;required_posting_auths&quot;: [&quot;steemit&quot;], &quot;id&quot;: &quot;follow&quot;, &quot;json&quot;: &quot;[\\&quot;follow\\&quot;,{\\&quot;follower\\&quot;:\\&quot;steemit\\&quot;,\\&quot;following\\&quot;:\\&quot;alice\\&quot;,\\&quot;what\\&quot;:[\\&quot;blog\\&quot;]}]&quot; } ] [ &quot;custom_json&quot;, { &quot;required_auths&quot;: [], &quot;required_posting_auths&quot;: [&quot;alice&quot;], &quot;id&quot;: &quot;follow&quot;, &quot;json&quot;: &quot;[\\&quot;follow\\&quot;,{\\&quot;follower\\&quot;:\\&quot;alice\\&quot;,\\&quot;following\\&quot;:\\&quot;eve\\&quot;,\\&quot;what\\&quot;:[\\&quot;ignore\\&quot;]}]&quot; } ] [ &quot;custom_json&quot;, { &quot;required_auths&quot;: [], &quot;required_posting_auths&quot;: [&quot;bob&quot;], &quot;id&quot;: &quot;reblog&quot;, &quot;json&quot;: &quot;{\\&quot;account\\&quot;:\\&quot;bob\\&quot;,\\&quot;author\\&quot;:\\&quot;alice\\&quot;,\\&quot;permlink\\&quot;:\\&quot;a-post-by-alice\\&quot;}&quot; } ] [ &quot;custom_json&quot;, { &quot;required_auths&quot;: [&quot;alice&quot;], &quot;required_posting_auths&quot;: [], &quot;id&quot;: &quot;witness&quot;, &quot;json&quot;: &quot;[\\&quot;enable_content_editing\\&quot;, {\\&quot;account\\&quot;: \\&quot;alice\\&quot;, \\&quot;relock_time\\&quot;: \\&quot;2100-01-01T12:00:00\\&quot;}]&quot; } ] comment_options Authors of posts may not want all of the benefits that come from creating a post. This operation allows authors to update properties associated with their post. Typically, these options will accompany a comment operation in the same transaction. As of HF17, content can specify beneficiaries to receive a part of their author rewards. The beneficiaries are specified in the extension field of the comment_options_operation and is a sorted vector (by account name) of account name, weight pairs. The beneficiaries can only be specified once and must be specified before any votes are cast on the comment. Most apps are already adding a comment_options in the transaction that creates the comment, so this should not be much of a challenge to add to existing apps. Notes: The max_accepted_payout may be decreased, but never increased. The percent_steem_dollars may be decreased, but never increased. Part of comment_option validation process, to be called when allowed_vote_assets object has been added as comment option extension are: When votable assets are greater than maximum votable assets: “Too much votable assets specified” When the symbol is not allowed in the list for votable assets: “STEEM can not be explicitly specified as one of allowed_vote_assets” max_accepted_payout: SBD value of the maximum payout this post will receive percent_steem_dollars: the percent of Steem Dollars to key, unkept amounts will be received as Steem Power allow_votes: allows/disallows a post to receive votes; allow_curation_rewards: allows/disllows voters to recieve curation rewards. Rewards return to reward fund. beneficiaries Must have at least one (empty beneficiaries not allowed). Cannot have more than 127 (witness currently only allow up to 8). Cannot allocate more than 100% of rewards to one account. Cannot allocate more than 100% of rewards to a comment. Must be specified in sorted order (account ascending; no duplicates).

In addition, those funds can be immediately vested again, circumventing the conversion from vests to steem and back, guaranteeing they maintain their value.

Roles: posting active owner Parameters: challenger challenged require_owner prove_authority Roles: active owner Parameters: challenged require_owner Since: HF11 request_account_recovery All account recovery requests come from a listed recovery account. This is secure based on the assumption that only a trusted account should be a recovery account. It is the responsibility of the recovery account to verify the identity of the account holder of the account to recover by whichever means they have agreed upon. The blockchain assumes identity has been verified when this operation is broadcast. This operation creates an account recovery request which the account to recover has 24 hours to respond to before the request expires and is invalidated. There can only be one active recovery request per account at any one time. Pushing this operation for an account to recover when it already has an active request will either update the request to a new new owner authority and extend the request expiration to 24 hours from the current head block time or it will delete the request. To cancel a request, simply set the weight threshold of the new owner authority to 0, making it an open authority. Additionally, the new owner authority must be satisfiable. In other words, the sum of the key weights must be greater than or equal to the weight threshold. This operation only needs to be signed by the the recovery account. The account to recover confirms its identity to the blockchain in the recover account operation. Notes: recovery_account: The recovery account is listed as the recovery account on the account to recover. account_to_recover: The account to recover. This is likely due to a compromised owner authority. new_owner_authority: The new owner authority the account to recover wishes to have. This is secret known by the account to recover and will be confirmed in a recover_account. See: #169 Roles: active owner Parameters: recovery_account account_to_recover new_owner_authority extensions Example Op: [ &quot;request_account_recovery&quot;, { &quot;recovery_account&quot;: &quot;steem&quot;, &quot;account_to_recover&quot;: &quot;alice&quot;, &quot;new_owner_authority&quot;: { &quot;weight_threshold&quot;: 1, &quot;account_auths&quot;: [], &quot;key_auths&quot;: [ [ &quot;STM6LYxj96zdypHYqgDdD6Nyh2NxerN3P1Mp3ddNm7gci63nfrSuZ&quot;, 1 ] ] }, &quot;extensions&quot;: [] } ] Since: HF11 recover_account Roles: owner Parameters: account_to_recover new_owner_authority recent_owner_authority extensions Example Op: [ &quot;recover_account&quot;, { &quot;account_to_recover&quot;: &quot;alice&quot;, &quot;new_owner_authority&quot;: { &quot;weight_threshold&quot;: 1, &quot;account_auths&quot;: [], &quot;key_auths&quot;: [ [ &quot;STM7j3nhkhHTpXqLEvdx2yEGhQeeorTcxSV6WDL2DZGxwUxYGrHvh&quot;, 1 ] ] }, &quot;recent_owner_authority&quot;: { &quot;weight_threshold&quot;: 1, &quot;account_auths&quot;: [], &quot;key_auths&quot;: [ [ &quot;STM78Xth94gNxp8nmByFV2vNAhg9bsSdviJ6fQXUTFikySLK3uTxC&quot;, 1 ] ] }, &quot;extensions&quot;: [] } ] Since: HF11 change_recovery_account Each account lists another account as their recovery account. The recovery account has the ability to create account_recovery_requests for the account to recover. An account can change their recovery account at any time with a 30 day delay. This delay is to prevent an attacker from changing the recovery account to a malicious account during an attack. These 30 days match the 30 days that an owner authority is valid for recovery purposes. On account creation the recovery account is set either to the creator of the account (The account that pays the creation fee and is a signer on the transaction) or to the empty string if the account was mined. An account with no recovery has the top voted witness as a recovery account, at the time the recover request is created. Note: This does mean the effective recovery account of an account with no listed recovery account can change at any time as witness vote weights. The top voted witness is explicitly the most trusted witness according to stake. See: #169 Roles: owner Parameters: account_to_recover new_recovery_account extensions Example Op: [ &quot;change_recovery_account&quot;, { &quot;account_to_recover&quot;: &quot;alice&quot;, &quot;new_recovery_account&quot;: &quot;bob&quot;, &quot;extensions&quot;: [] } ] Since: HF14 escrow_transfer The purpose of this operation is to enable someone to send money contingently to another individual. The funds leave the from account and go into a temporary balance where they are held until from releases it to to or to refunds it to from. In the event of a dispute the agent can divide the funds between the to/from account. Disputes can be raised any time before or on the dispute deadline time, after the escrow has been approved by all parties. This operation only creates a proposed escrow transfer. Both the agent and to must agree to the terms of the arrangement by approving the escrow. The escrow agent is paid the fee on approval of all parties. It is up to the escrow agent to determine the fee. Escrow transactions are uniquely identified by from and escrow_id, the escrow_id is defined by the sender. See: steem_operations.hpp:229 Roles: active owner Parameters: from to agent escrow_id sbd_amount steem_amount fee ratification_deadline escrow_expiration json_meta Example Op: [ &quot;escrow_transfer&quot;, { &quot;from&quot;: &quot;alice&quot;, &quot;to&quot;: &quot;bob&quot;, &quot;sbd_amount&quot;: { &quot;amount&quot;: &quot;1000&quot;, &quot;precision&quot;: 3, &quot;nai&quot;: &quot;@@000000013&quot; }, &quot;steem_amount&quot;: { &quot;amount&quot;: &quot;0&quot;, &quot;precision&quot;: 3, &quot;nai&quot;: &quot;@@000000021&quot; }, &quot;escrow_id&quot;: 23456789, &quot;agent&quot;: &quot;charlie&quot;, &quot;fee&quot;: { &quot;amount&quot;: &quot;100&quot;, &quot;precision&quot;: 3, &quot;nai&quot;: &quot;@@000000013&quot; }, &quot;json_meta&quot;: &quot;{}&quot;, &quot;ratification_deadline&quot;: &quot;2017-02-26T11:22:39&quot;, &quot;escrow_expiration&quot;: &quot;2017-02-28T11:22:39&quot; } ] Since: HF14 escrow_dispute If either the sender or receiver of an escrow payment has an issue, they can raise it for dispute. Once a payment is in dispute, the agent has authority over who gets what. See: steem_operations.hpp:229 Roles: active owner Parameters: from to agent who escrow_id Example Op: [ &quot;escrow_dispute&quot;, { &quot;from&quot;: &quot;alice&quot;, &quot;to&quot;: &quot;bob&quot;, &quot;agent&quot;: &quot;charlie&quot;, &quot;who&quot;: &quot;alice&quot;, &quot;escrow_id&quot;: 72526562 } ] Since: HF14 escrow_release This operation can be used by anyone associated with the escrow transfer to release funds if they have permission. The permission scheme is as follows: If there is no dispute and escrow has not expired, either party can release funds to the other. If escrow expires and there is no dispute, either party can release funds to either party. If there is a dispute regardless of expiration, the agent can release funds to either party following whichever agreement was in place between the parties.

Once a party approves the escrow, they cannot revoke their approval. Subsequent escrow approve operations, regardless of the approval, will be rejected. See: steem_operations.hpp:229 Roles: active owner Parameters: from to agent who escrow_id approve Example Op: [ &quot;escrow_approve&quot;, { &quot;from&quot;: &quot;alice&quot;, &quot;to&quot;: &quot;bob&quot;, &quot;agent&quot;: &quot;charlie&quot;, &quot;who&quot;: &quot;charlie&quot;, &quot;escrow_id&quot;: 59102208, &quot;approve&quot;: true } ] Since: HF14 transfer_to_savings For time locked savings accounts. A user can place Steem and Steem Dollars into time locked savings balances. Funds can be withdrawn from these balances after a three day delay. The point of this addition is to mitigate loss from hacked and compromised account. The max a user can lose instantaneously is the sum of what the hold in liquid balances. Assuming an account can be recovered quickly, loss in such situations can be kept to a minimum.

The json deserialization has a non-trivial cost associated with it. This operation will allow for binary deserialization of plugin operations and should improve overall performance of plugins that chose to use it. See: steem_operations.hpp:491 Roles: posting active owner Parameters: id data Since: HF14 decline_voting_rights An account can chose to decline their voting rights after a 30 day delay. This includes voting on content and witnesses. The voting rights cannot be acquired again once they have been declined. This is only to formalize a smart contract between certain accounts and the community that currently only exists as a social contract. See: steem_operations.hpp:897 Roles: owner Parameters: account decline Example Op: [ &quot;decline_voting_rights&quot;, {&quot;account&quot;: &quot;judy&quot;, &quot;decline&quot;: true} ] Since: HF11 Disabled reset_account This operation allows recovery_account to change account_to_reset’s owner authority to new_owner_authority after 60 days of inactivity. See: #169 Roles: active owner Parameters: reset_account account_to_reset new_owner_authority Since: HF11 Disabled set_reset_account This operation allows account owner to control which account has the power to execute the reset_account operation after 60 days.

The vesting shares are still owned by the original account, but content voting rights and bandwidth allocation are transferred to the receiving account. This sets the delegation to vesting_shares, increasing it or decreasing it as needed (i.e. a delegation of 0 removes the delegation). When a delegation is removed the shares are placed in limbo for a week to prevent a satoshi of VESTS from voting on the same content twice. Also see: steem_evaluator.cpp:2309 Roles: active owner Parameters: delegator delegatee vesting_shares Example Op: [ &quot;delegate_vesting_shares&quot;, { &quot;delegator&quot;: &quot;alice&quot;, &quot;delegatee&quot;: &quot;bob&quot;, &quot;vesting_shares&quot;: { &quot;amount&quot;: &quot;94599167138276&quot;, &quot;precision&quot;: 6, &quot;nai&quot;: &quot;@@000000037&quot; } } ] Since: HF17 account_create_with_delegation Instead of paying the entire account creation fee with Steem, creators can now pay a smaller fee (30x less) and delegate some Steem Power for 30 days. The exact amount is 5 * min_fee + STEEM_POWER == 150 * min_fee. You can pay any combination of STEEM and Steem Power along that curve (so long as the minimum fee is paid). The witness voted STEEM fee is now the minimum required STEEM fee for delegation. Witnesses should reduce their fee by 30x when the hardfork goes live to preserve the same required fee for an all STEEM account creation.

<p>An operation on Steem is a way of expressing intention on the blockchain.
They are also known as Broadcast Operations.  They have types, like <code class="highlighter-rouge">vote</code>
or <code class="highlighter-rouge">comment</code>.  They pass parameters like <code class="highlighter-rouge">author</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">permlink</code>, depending
on what their purpose is.</p>

<p>Operations are grouped into transactions and passed as parameters to
methods like <code class="highlighter-rouge">network_broadcast_api.broadcast_transaction_synchronous</code>, in
the <code class="highlighter-rouge">operations</code> array.  Transactions must be signed in order for the
blockchain to accept them.  Here is an example of a transaction that
contains one operation (shown without signatures).</p>

</h4>
<p>This operation is used to cast a vote on a post/comment.  The primary
purpose of voting is to express Proof-of-Brain about content to the
blockchain.  When a vote is cast, the content is considered in the
consensus rules involving author and curation rewards.</p>

<p>An upvote can be cast from the point in time that the content is created
up to 6.5 days.  The remaining 12 hours are locked out of upvotes at
which time only downvotes may be cast.</p>

<p>A secondary aspect to voting involves reputation, which is not part of
consensus.</p>

<p><em>Reputation Rules:</em></p>
<ol>
  <li>Must have non-negative reputation to effect another user’s reputation.</li>
  <li>If you are down voting another user, you must have more reputation than them to impact their reputation.</li>

<p>This operation is used to report a miner who signs two blocks
at the same time. To be valid, the violation must be reported within
STEEM_MAX_WITNESSES blocks of the head block (1 round) and the
producer must be in the ACTIVE witness set.</p>

<p>Users not in the ACTIVE witness set should not have to worry about their
key getting compromised and being used to produced multiple blocks so
the attacker can report it and steel their vesting steem.</p>

of the block producer to the reporter.</p>

<p>Serves the same purpose as <code class="highlighter-rouge">custom</code> but also supports required posting

readable/developer friendly.</p>

<h5 id="follow"><code class="highlighter-rouge">follow</code></h5>

<p>As of HF9, the follow plugin will track follow/unfollow/ignore events.</p>

<h5 id="reblog"><code class="highlighter-rouge">reblog</code></h5>

<p>As of HF14, allows users to share blogs they find with those who follow
them. This change implemented entirely outside the blockchain consensus
which means that reblogging does not create a new post, it merely shares
an existing post with people who follow you.</p>

<h5 id="witness"><code class="highlighter-rouge">witness</code></h5>

<p>As of HF18, the witness plugin has a custom operation called
<code class="highlighter-rouge">enable_content_editing</code> that allows a user to signal they want to edit
their content. By consensus, content is editable indefinitely, but is
soft forked to be frozen after payout. This operation requires an
<code class="highlighter-rouge">active</code> key and is designed to prevent vandalism if a posting key is
compromised. <a href="https://github.com/steemit/steem/issues/1017">#1017</a></p>

<p>Authors of posts may not want all of the benefits that come from creating a post. This
operation allows authors to update properties associated with their post.</p>

<p>Typically, these options will accompany a <code class="highlighter-rouge">comment</code> operation in the same transaction.</p>

<p>As of HF17, content can specify beneficiaries to receive a part of
their author rewards. The beneficiaries are specified in the extension
field of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">comment_options_operation</code> and is a sorted vector (by
account name) of account name, weight pairs. The beneficiaries can only
be specified once and must be specified before any votes are cast on the
comment. Most apps are already adding a <code class="highlighter-rouge">comment_options</code> in the
transaction that creates the comment, so this should not be much of a
challenge to add to existing apps.</p>

<p>All account recovery requests come from a listed recovery account. This
is secure based on the assumption that only a trusted account should be
a recovery account. It is the responsibility of the recovery account to
verify the identity of the account holder of the account to recover by
whichever means they have agreed upon. The blockchain assumes identity
has been verified when this operation is broadcast.</p>

<p>This operation creates an account recovery request which the account to
recover has 24 hours to respond to before the request expires and is
invalidated.</p>

<p>There can only be one active recovery request per account at any one time.
Pushing this operation for an account to recover when it already has
an active request will either update the request to a new new owner authority
and extend the request expiration to 24 hours from the current head block
time or it will delete the request. To cancel a request, simply set the
weight threshold of the new owner authority to 0, making it an open authority.</p>

<p>Additionally, the new owner authority must be satisfiable. In other words,
the sum of the key weights must be greater than or equal to the weight
threshold.</p>

<p>This operation only needs to be signed by the the recovery account.
The account to recover confirms its identity to the blockchain in
the recover account operation.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">recovery_account</code>: The recovery account is listed as the recovery account
on the account to recover.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">account_to_recover</code>: The account to recover. This is likely due to a

<p>Each account lists another account as their recovery account.
The recovery account has the ability to create <code class="highlighter-rouge">account_recovery_requests</code>
for the account to recover. An account can change their recovery account
at any time with a 30 day delay. This delay is to prevent
an attacker from changing the recovery account to a malicious account
during an attack. These 30 days match the 30 days that an
owner authority is valid for recovery purposes.</p>

<p>On account creation the recovery account is set either to the creator of
the account (The account that pays the creation fee and is a signer on the transaction)
or to the empty string if the account was mined. An account with no recovery
has the top voted witness as a recovery account, at the time the recover
request is created. Note: This does mean the effective recovery account
of an account with no listed recovery account can change at any time as
witness vote weights. The top voted witness is explicitly the most trusted
witness according to stake.</p>

<p>The purpose of this operation is to enable someone to send money
contingently to another individual. The funds leave the <em>from</em> account
and go into a temporary balance where they are held until <em>from</em>
releases it to <em>to</em> or <em>to</em> refunds it to <em>from</em>.</p>

<p>In the event of a dispute the <em>agent</em> can divide the funds between the
to/from account. Disputes can be raised any time before or on the
dispute deadline time, after the escrow has been approved by all
parties.</p>

<p>This operation only creates a proposed escrow transfer. Both the <em>agent</em>
and <em>to</em> must agree to the terms of the arrangement by approving the
escrow.</p>

<p>The escrow agent is paid the fee on approval of all parties. It is up to
the escrow agent to determine the fee.</p>

<p>Escrow transactions are uniquely identified by <code class="highlighter-rouge">from</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">escrow_id</code>,
the <code class="highlighter-rouge">escrow_id</code> is defined by the sender.</p>

<p>Delegate vesting shares from one account to the other. The vesting
shares are still owned by the original account, but content voting
rights and bandwidth allocation are transferred to the receiving
account. This sets the delegation to <code class="highlighter-rouge">vesting_shares</code>, increasing it or
decreasing it as needed (i.e. a delegation of 0 removes the delegation).</p>

<p>When a delegation is removed the shares are placed in limbo for a week
to prevent a satoshi of VESTS from voting on the same content twice.</p>

<p>Instead of paying the entire account creation fee with Steem, creators
can now pay a smaller fee (30x less) and delegate some Steem Power for
30 days. The exact amount is 5 * min_fee + STEEM_POWER == 150 * min_fee.
You can pay any combination of STEEM and Steem Power along that curve
(so long as the minimum fee is paid).</p>

<p><em>The witness voted STEEM fee is now the minimum required STEEM fee for
delegation. Witnesses should reduce their fee by 30x when the hardfork
goes live to preserve the same required fee for an all STEEM account
creation.</em></p>
